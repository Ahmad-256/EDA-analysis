This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the famous Titanic dataset, performed using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

The analysis aims to uncover key insights into the survival patterns of passengers based on various features including:

🧍 Passenger Demographics
Age, gender, class, and family size distributions

💼 Socioeconomic Influence
Impact of ticket class, fare paid, and embarkation port on survival

🛟 Survival Rate Analysis
Survival comparisons across gender, class, age groups, and combined features

📊 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handling missing values, feature engineering (e.g., creating "FamilySize", "IsAlone"), and converting categorical variables for better analysis

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
Pandas – for data manipulation and wrangling

NumPy – for numerical operations

Seaborn – for statistical visualizations

Matplotlib – for general-purpose plotting

📁 Dataset: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle) / sns.load_dataset("titanic")
📌 Objective: Explore the data, visualize patterns, and prepare a foundation for machine learning modeling.

This EDA lays the groundwork for deeper machine learning modeling and helps understand how different variables affected passengers’ chances of survival aboard the RMS Titanic.
